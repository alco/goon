Goon
====

Goon is a companion program for the [Porcelain][1] library written in Elixir.

## Usage with Porcelain

Go to [Releases][2] and pick the `goon` binary for your system. Put it
somewhere in your `PATH` (or into the directory that will become the current
working directory of your application).

Always download the latest release. Goon will forever be backwards compatible
with _all_ past releases of Porcelain. The old releases are kept online merely
for history.
